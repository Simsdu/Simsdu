## Hi, i'm Simon 👋
I'm actually a pharmacy student passionate about cybersecurity, currently self-learning through platforms like TryHackMe, various books, and different Linux environnments.

I'm building step-by-step skills in offensive, defensive security, and core cybersecurity fundamentals such as networking, operating systems, hardware architecture etc. My goal is to join an engineeting school specialized in cybersecurity. 
### What i'm currently doing
- Self-directed learning in cybersecurity
- Completing pratical labs, challenges and CTFs
- Documenting my progress and methods
- Developing skills in penetration testing and system analysis
### My Portofolio
You can check all my work here:

👉 https://github.com/Simsdu/portofolio_cyber


It includes:
- My writeups
- Descriptions of the TryHackMe certifications i've completed
- My technical evolution over time

Each folder has a dedicated README explaining its content.
### Goal
Continue building my skills to join a cybersecurity engineering program.
My aim is to apply these skills in a defensive and SOC-oriented path. 

I want to focus on understanding attacks deeply so i can detect, analyze, and respond to them effectively.
