## Hi, i'm Simon 👋
I'm a pharmacy student passionate about cybersecurity, currently self-learning through platforms like TryHackMe, various books, and different Linux environnments.

I'm gradually building skills in offensive and defensive security, as well as core cybersecurity fundamentals such as networking, operating systems, hardware architecture. 

My goal is to join an engineering school specialized in cybersecurity. 
### What i'm currently doing
- Self-directed learning in cybersecurity
- Completing practical labs, challenges and CTFs
- Documenting my progress and methods
- Developing skills in penetration testing and system analysis
### My Portofolio
You can check all my work here:

👉 https://github.com/Simsdu/portofolio_cyber


It includes:
- My writeups
- Descriptions of the TryHackMe certifications i've completed
- My technical evolution over time

Each folder has a dedicated README explaining its content.
### Goal
Continue building my skills to join a cybersecurity engineering program.
My aim is to apply these skills in a defensive and SOC-oriented path. 

I want to focus on understanding attacks deeply so that i can detect, analyze, and respond to them effectively.
